This spam classifier is designed to be a demonstration of the Artificial Intelligence Development Environment (AIDE)'s capability to connect to an external repository and train a model. In this case the model will be an mlflow pyfunc model that will classify spam emails from raw text using sklearn's TfidfVectorizer and either SCV, RandomForestClassifer, or MultinomialNB. spam_model.py expects the path to the dataset to be trained on as well as the classifier: either "SVC", "RandomForestClassifier", or "NaiveBayes"
